                    What if dragons from Game of Thrones existed on Earth? This paper seeks to examine this question under an initial assumption that dragons 
                    that dragons are in fact rational agents that seek to optimize by avoiding other dragons and instead seeking to maximize 
                    their comparative advantage within a selective niche that minimizes the energy wasted on competition.

                    This paper offers an exploration into a work of art by German painter Rune Mields that models the Sieve of Erastothenes and 
                    debates whether it should be included into 
                    the Art Humanities curriculum at Columbia. By comparing its style to that of Andy Warhol and the Pop Art movement that is 
                    fundamentally predicated on post-modernism, I argue that this work would offer a useful juxtaposition in the quest to 
                    answer two questions: What is the nature of truth? And is all creativity ultimately derivative (i.e. derived from a deterministic 
                    source rather than offering a truly novel medium through which one may interpret the world)?
                    Rather than offering answers to these questions, the paper argues that Rune Mields work would provoke these questions 
                    from Warhol's work.

                <h2>The Fall of Man: A Critical Analysis into the Origins of Evil</h2>
                <p>See paper <a href="https://github.com/robisonJohn/Portfolio-Revised/blob/main/The%20Fall%20of%20Man-2.pdf">here</a></p>

                    What is the origin of evil? Are humans born evil (nature) or does evil derive from external sources (nurture)? In this essay,
                    I examine three distinct works in cinema (Peppermint Candy, Star Wars, and Dark) that delve deeply into the origin story of 
                    antagonists that began as heroes. The paper argues that the most interesting protagonists, at least in cinema, are heroes who 
                    experience the three fundamental losses of innocence, naivety, and life itself; and thereby enter into a state of "death before death"
                    in which the body is alive but the soul is dead. Within this chasm that lacks either purpose and truth, evil arises and flourishes and
                    truly dynamic villains are incarnated.
