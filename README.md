# John Robison's Portfolio

## Overview
John Robison's Portfolio is a full-stack application with the goal of effectively communicating my skills to potential employers. It will consist of a homepage with my contact information and general contact information, General Assembly projects, math projects, writing samples, and favorite books. The favorite books section will have full CRUD functionality.

The greatest challenges I expect to face will be using Ruby on Rails; we only just started learning rails, so I admit I have certain trepidations about building a full-stack application with this framework. That being said, I'm super excited to use this project as an opportunity to really understand the nuts and bolts of rails and determine exactly how I can most effectively use this tool to process data! Given my concern with Ruby, I also think time will pose a significant issue. With only four days to actually build this application, it isn't enough to simply "work harder." Rather, I will need to be <em>meticulous</em> in my planning to ensure no moment is wasted.

## MVP

### Server (Back-End)
The server will have the following minimal functionality:
<ul>
  <li>Have a <strong>RESTful JSON API</strong></li>
  <ul>
    <li>Build a Ruby on Rails server, exposing RESTful JSON endpoints</li>
    <li>Build a database with 3 tables: authors, books, and genres.</li>
    <li>Utilize <strong>Rails</strong> to define models for interacting with the database.</li>
    <li>Implement working generic controller actions for Full CRUD (index, show, create, update, delete) between your non-User tables</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

### Client
The front-end will have the following minimal functionality:
<ul>
  <li>Have a working, interactive <strong>React</strong> app, built using npx create-react-app</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Have 13 React components in an organized and understandable React file structure.</li>
    <li>Utilize functional or class React components appropriately</li>
    <li>Utilize state and props in your components efficiently</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Consume my data from <strong>Ruby on Rails API</strong> and render this data within the components.</li>
  <li>Utilize <strong>React Router</strong> for client-side routing</li>
  <li>Demonstrate Full CRUD actions (index, show, create, update, and delete) on the front end.</li>
</ul>

### Styling 
<ul>
  <li>Be styled with CSS.</li>
  <li>Use Flexbox or Grid in layout design.</li>
  <li>Implement 2 media queries for responsive design on 2 screen sizes (including desktop).</li>
</ul>

### Linting
<ul>
  <li>Indent properly.</li>
  <li>Utilize high-quality, semantic variable names.</li>
  <li>Follow camelCase, snake_case, or kebab-case convention.</li>
  <li>Remove unnecessary boilerplate React files and code.</li>
  <li>Remove all console.log() statements and commented out code that are not direct comments on present code blocks.</li>
</ul>

### Deployment
<ul>
  <li>Deploy fully-functional front-end via Netlify.</li>
  <li>Deploy back-end via Heroku.</li>
  <li>Deploy early and often.</li>
</ul>

### Procedural
<ul>
  <li>Initialize a <strong>git repo on Github</strong>, with a link to the hosted project.</li>
  <li>Have <strong>frequent commits</strong>, making a <em>robust</em> commit history at least every day (75 commits minimum).</li>
  <li>Use effective and safe <strong>branching and merging</strong> processes.</li>
</ul>
